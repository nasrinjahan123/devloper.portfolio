            <p>Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit the
                security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using
                a password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system. Computers have become mandatory to
                run a successful businesses. It is not enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be
                networked to facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to the outside world
                and hacking. System hacking means using computers to commit fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy
                invasion, stealing cor porate/personal data, etc. Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of
                dollars every year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.</p>

            <h2>Become a ethical hacker</h2>
            <p>Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or pen testing, is legally breaking into computers and
                devices to test an organization's defenses. It's among the most exciting IT jobs any person can be
                involved in. You are literally getting paid to keep up with the latest technology and get to break into
                computers without the threat of being arrested. </p>

                        <p>I’ve been in computer security for over 30 years, and no job has been more challenging and
                            fun
                            than professional penetration testing. You not only get to do something fun, but pen testers
                            often are seen with an aura of extra coolness that comes from everyone knowing they could
                            break
                            into almost any computer at will.</p>

                        <p>This is what the ethical hacker is being paid for – the “break-in.” Using the information
                            learned
                            in the discovery phase, the pen tester needs to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized
                            access (or denial of service, if that is the goal). If the hacker can’t break-in to a
                            particular
                            asset, then they must try other in-scope assets.</p>
