            <p>Hacking is the activity of identifying weaknesses in a computer system or a network to exploit the
                security to gain access to personal data or business data. An example of computer hacking can be: using
                a password cracking algorithm to gain access to a computer system. Computers have become mandatory to
                run a successful businesses. It is not enough to have isolated computers systems; they need to be
                networked to facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to the outside world
                and hacking. System hacking means using computers to commit fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy
                invasion, stealing cor porate/personal data, etc. Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of
                dollars every year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.</p>
